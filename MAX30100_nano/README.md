# Firmware development
Firmware embedded in earpiece using MAX30100 which is known as heart rate one click. **Photoplethysmogram** (PPG) is optically obtained as an output. 

## Getting started

### Prerequesites

>1. Download and install [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) IDE 1.8.5+.
>2. Purchase [MAX30100](https://au.rs-online.com/web/p/sensor-development-kits/1360770/) (heart rate one click)
>3. [Arduino Nano v3] (https://www.jaycar.com.au/duinotech-nano-board-arduino-compatible/p/XC4414)
